    "I understand. You're looking for the more advanced and niche formatting options that go beyond the basic headers and bold text. Jupyter's Markdown parser (based on CommonMark and MathJax) includes several specialized features for technical documentation.Here is an exhaustive list of the remaining Markdown features and syntax supported in Jupyter.1. Advanced Math (Multi-line & Alignment)For complex proofs or derivations, you can use LaTeX environments within your Markdown cells.Example: Aligned Equations$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} &= \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} \\\\\n",
    "\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} &= 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$2. Task Lists (Checklists)Useful for project management within a notebook to track progress.Markdown- [x] Data cleaning completed\n",
    "- [x] Feature engineering\n",
    "- [ ] Model training (In progress)\n",
    "- [ ] Deployment\n",
    "3. Definition ListsWhile not standard in all Markdown flavors, Jupyter supports HTML-based definition lists for glossaries.HTML<dl>\n",
    "  <dt>Supervised Learning</dt>\n",
    "  <dd>Algorithms that learn from labeled training data.</dd>\n",
    "  <dt>Unsupervised Learning</dt>\n",
    "  <dd>Algorithms that find patterns in unlabeled data.</dd>\n",
    "</dl>\n",
    "4. Alert Boxes (Bootstrap Classes)Jupyter uses Bootstrap CSS, allowing you to create colored \"Alert\" boxes to highlight specific types of information.HTML<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> Use blue boxes for general tips or notes.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",

    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>Error:</b> Use red boxes for critical warnings or potential errors.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "5. Anchors and Internal LinkingYou can create links that jump to other sections of the same notebook.Step 1: Create the anchor (Usually at a heading):<a id=\"target_section\"></a>Step 2: Link to it:[Jump to Target](#target_section)6. Formatting Text with HTMLSince Markdown is a subset of HTML, you can use tags for more granular control:Text Color: <span style=\"color:red\">Red Text</span> → <span style=\"color:red\">Red Text</span>Superscript/Subscript: H<sub>2</sub>O (H₂O) or x<sup>2</sup> (x²)Line Breaks: Use <br> for a hard return without a new paragraph.7. Embedding MediaBeyond simple images, you can embed videos or interactive elements.YouTube Video:HTML<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://youtu.be/wUSDVGivd-8?si=U8j8CLPJ9kulxwnv\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

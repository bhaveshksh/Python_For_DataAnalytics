# Hospital Management Project Plan

## Project Overview
Develop a Hospital Management System in Python to manage hospital operations efficiently. The system will include the following core entities and features:

## Class Entities
1. **Hospital**
2. **Department**
3. **Doctor**
4. **Patient**
5. **Prescription**
6. **Billing**

## Features & Functional Requirements
- **Admit Patient**: Register and admit new patients to the hospital.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Schedule appointments for patients with doctors.
- **Diagnosis**: Record diagnosis details for patients.
- **Prescription Management**: Doctors prescribe medicines to patients based on diagnosis.
- **Billing**: Generate and manage bills for patient services and treatments.
- **Discharge**: Discharge patients and update records.
- **Re-checkup Scheduling**: Schedule follow-up appointments for patients.

## Detailed Plan of Action

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Gather detailed requirements for each feature.
- Define data attributes for each entity (Hospital, Department, Doctor, Patient, Prescription, Billing).

### 2. System Design
- Design class diagrams for all entities.
- Define relationships between entities (e.g., Patient-Doctor, Doctor-Department).
- Plan data storage (in-memory, file-based, or database).

### 3. Implementation Steps
- Set up project structure and main Python files.
- Implement classes for each entity with required attributes and methods.
- Develop core features:
  - Patient admission and registration
  - Appointment scheduling
  - Diagnosis and prescription
  - Billing system
  - Discharge process
  - Re-checkup scheduling
- Implement user interface (CLI or GUI as required).

### 4. Testing
- Write test cases for each feature and entity.
- Perform integration testing to ensure all modules work together.

### 5. Documentation
- Document code and provide a user manual.
- Prepare usage examples and instructions.

### 6. Deployment
- Package the application for distribution.
- Provide setup instructions.

## Timeline (Suggested)
- **Week 1**: Requirements analysis and system design
- **Week 2**: Entity class implementation
- **Week 3**: Feature development (admission, appointment, diagnosis, prescription)
- **Week 4**: Billing, discharge, re-checkup, and testing
- **Week 5**: Documentation and deployment
